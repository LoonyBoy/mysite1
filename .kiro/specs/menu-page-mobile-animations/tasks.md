  - Ensure smooth transitions between normal and expanded states
  - Add proper mobile viewport handling (100dvh support)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Enhance Mobile Particle Color Integration
  - Integrate particle color changes with mobile card hover states
  - Modify existing particle system to respond to mobile touch interactions
  - Implement smooth color transitions from original to black on mobile hover
  - Ensure particle color changes work with bounds-based detection on mobile
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Optimize Mobile Modal Animations
  - Improve modal opening/closing animations specifically for mobile devices
  - Add better easing functions and timing for mobile interactions
  - Implement staggered animations for modal content on mobile
  - Optimize animation performance for mobile hardware limitations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 5. Add Mobile Touch Interaction Patterns
  - Replace desktop hover effects with mobile-appropriate touch interactions
  - Implement tap-to-expand functionality for mobile card interactions
  - Add visual feedback for touch interactions (haptic-like animations)
  - Ensure proper touch target sizing (minimum 44px) for mobile accessibility
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement Mobile Performance Optimizations
  - Add mobile device detection and performance monitoring

  - Optimize GSAP timeline management for mobile memory constraints
  - Add mobile-specific CSS optimizations for hardware acceleration
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 7. Add Mobile Accessibility Features
  - Implement mobile-specific reduced motion support
  - Add mobile keyboard navigation alternatives for touch interactions
  - Create mobile screen reader friendly animation descriptions
  - Add mobile-specific option to disable animations completely
  - _Requirements: 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Mobile Animation Error Handling
  - Add mobile-specific error handling for touch interactions
  - Implement fallback animations for failed mobile animations
  - Create automatic recovery from mobile animation errors
  - Add mobile performance logging and monitoring
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Mobile CSS Enhancements
